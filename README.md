The mobile application relies on the existence of a Bluetooth-compatible 3D pasta printer, to
print unique pasta products from CAD files. The app allows pasta manufacturers to promote 
pasta product of different innovative shapes whereas the customer is able to choose the shape, 
the material’s ingredients and the amount of the pasta to print for his meal. Apart from that, the 
user is able to share his experience through a networked community. The app allows taking 
pictures, rating and describing the taste and recipe of printed pasta meals, as well as reviewing 
the meals of others creating an ongoing customer dialogue. 

This scenario aspires to increase interaction between pasta manufacturers and clients, with 
beneficial impact for both sides. For companies, the artifact substitutes the need to assign 
significant resources in research and development for fulfilling the customers’ needs as well as 
dedicating product lines in testing new products. Customers’ voice would be integrated in the 
new product development process from its early stages so the products will be expected to 
maximize customer satisfaction. Last but not least, the application patronizes customer 
engagement behaviors, like rating and blogging about products which is expected to increase 
behavioral manifestation towards the firm.
